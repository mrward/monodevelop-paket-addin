# Features

In the following sections the features are covered in more detail.

## Adding a NuGet Package

To add a NuGet package using Paket, right click the project in the Solution window, and select **Add** - **Add NuGet Packages using Paket**.

The **Add NuGet Packages using Paket** menu is also available from the main Project menu.

## Paket Dependencies Folder

The Paket Dependencies folder is shown in the Solution window if Xamarin Studio finds a paket.dependencies file in the same directory as the solution. The NuGet packages that are in the paket.dependencies file are shown under this folder.

Double clicking the folder will open the paket.dependencies file into the text editor. The Paket Dependencies folder also has a context menu where you can run Paket commands. From the context menu you can Add a NuGet Package as a dependency, install, restore, update, and simplify your dependencies, or check for updates.

To update a single NuGet package you can right click it and select Update. To remove the NuGet package as a dependency you can right click it and select Remove or press delete.

## Paket References Folder

The Paket References folder is shown in the Solution window if Xamarin Studio finds a paket.references file in the same directory as the project. The NuGet packages that are in the paket.references file are shown under this folder. Double clicking the folder will open the paket.references file into the text editor.

Right clicking the Paket References folder allows you to add a NuGet package to the project. A NuGet package can be removed by right clicking it and selecting Remove or by pressing Delete.

## Code Completion

When editing the paket.dependencies file you will get code completion as you type. You can also bring up the code completion list by pressing Ctrl+Enter.
